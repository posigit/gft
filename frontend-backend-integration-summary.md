1. **Complete API Service Implementation:**
   - Implemented all API endpoints in the frontend service
   - Replaced mock data with real API calls
   - Added proper error handling for all API requests
   - Created fallback options for development/testing

2. **Type Definitions Alignment:**
   - Updated frontend type definitions to match backend schema
   - Added support for new fields in models (categories, responses, etc.)
   - Ensured consistent naming between frontend and backend

3. **Authentication Flow:**
   - Implemented complete JWT authentication with token refresh
   - Added secure role-based access control
   - Created proper login/logout functionality

4. **Data Management:**
   - Connected all CRUD operations to the backend
   - Implemented filtering and sorting of data
   - Added support for real-time data updates

5. **Advanced Features:**
   - Integrated QR code generation between frontend and backend
   - Connected dashboard data visualization to real backend statistics
   - Implemented Excel and PDF export functionality

## Testing Results

All API endpoints have been tested and are working correctly. The application can now:

- Authenticate users with proper role-based permissions
- Manage users, hotels, feedback, and categories
- Generate and display QR codes for hotel feedback
- Display real-time dashboard statistics and reports
- Export data in Excel and PDF formats

## Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment:**
   - Update API URLs for production environment
   - Configure environment-specific settings
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Implement data caching for frequently accessed information
   - Add pagination for large data sets
   - Optimize API calls to reduce bandwidth usage

3. **Enhanced Features:**
   - Add real-time notifications using WebSockets
   - Implement advanced filtering and search functionality
   - Create mobile-friendly optimizations

4. **Documentation:**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Add user guides for different user roles
   - Document system architecture and design patterns

## Conclusion

The Presken Guest Feedback Tracker (GFT) is now fully integrated between frontend and backend, providing a seamless experience for both super admins and hotel admins. The application is ready for testing in a production-like environment, with all core features implemented and working correctly.

This integration successfully removes the reliance on mock data, allowing the application to operate with real database information while maintaining the user experience and functionality defined in the requirements.
